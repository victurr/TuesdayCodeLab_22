*CODING LABS (HOME SESSION 1)  ________________________________________________________________________________*

*QUESTION 1:*
Write a function called *dataTypes* to compare and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. Follow through the test to produce the perfect function that accounts for all expectations.
For strings, return its length.
For null or undefined return string 'no value'
For booleans return the boolean
For numbers return a string showing how it compares to hundred e.g. For 67 return 'less than 100' for 4034 return 'more than 100' or equal to 100 as the case may be
For arrays return the 3rd index, or undefined if it doesn't exist.
For functions call the function and pass in true as an argument and return it.

*QUESTION 2:*
Write a function called *findMinMax* to find the maximum and minimum elements of an array. Your answer should be returned in an array containing the min and max number, respectively.
